                &#x201C;I should see the garden far better,&#x201D;
                said Alice to herself, &#x201C;if I could get to the
                top of that hill; and here&#x2019;s a path that leads
                straight to it&#x2014;at least, it doesn&#x2019;t do 
                <Italic>that</Italic>&#x2014;&#x201D; (after going
                a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp
                corners), &#x201C;but I suppose it will at last. But
                how curiously it twists! It&#x2019;s more like a 
                corkscrew than a path! Well, <Italic>this</Italic>
                turn goes to the hill, I suppose&#x2014;no, it
                doesn&#x2019;t! This goes straight back to the house!
                Well then, I&#x2019;ll try it the other way.&#x201D;
