                &#x201C;Curioser and curioser!&#x201D; cried Alice
                (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she
                quite forgot how to speak good English). &#x201C;Now
                I&#x2019;m opening out like the largest telescope that
                ever was! Good-bye, feet!&#x201D; (for when she 
                looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost
                out of sight, they were getting so far off).
                &#x201C;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will
                put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
                I&#x2019;m sure <Italic>I</Italic> sha&#x2019;n&#x2019;t
                be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
                myself about you: you must manage the best way you 
                can&#x2014;but I must be kind to them,&#x201D;
                thought Alice, &#x201C;or perhaps they won&#x2019;t
                walk the way I want to go! Let me see. I&#x2019;ll
                give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&#x201D;
